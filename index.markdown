I’m the Co-founder and CTO at Malted AI, distilling LLM solutions for enterprise. Previously at <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.meta.com/research/">__Meta AI Research__</a>, doing synthetic data for LLMs alongside the Llama 2 and CodeLlama teams. I’m finishing a Ph.D. at the University of Glasgow, on tool reasoning for language models under <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/jeffdalton/">Jeff Dalton</a>.

<!-- I'm a **Ph.D. student** at the University of Glasgow supervised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/jeffdalton/">Jeff Dalton</a>. Incoming intern at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/jeffdalton/">__Meta AI Research__</a> with <a target="_blank" href="http://timoschick.com">Timo Schick</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://mlomeli1.github.io">Maria Lomeli</a>. -->

I **led the winning team** for the [__2021-2022 Amazon Alexa Prize TaskBot challenge__](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/three-top-performers-emerge-in-inaugural-alexa-prize-taskbot-challenge){:target="_blank"}.

I explore how language models can decouple memorisation from reasoning. Specifically how they can delegate computation and knowledge by using tools. Similar to how we use calculators to do math. 

I apply my research in the context of __Question Answering__ and __Conversational Systems__ to make language model reasoning more capable and interpretable.
